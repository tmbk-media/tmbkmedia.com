## Who we are
Hailing from Perth, writers Natalie Williams and Krista Heath met while studying Professional Writing and Publishing at Curtin University. The dynamic duo and forever storytellers finally started putting pen to paper in 2023. Their first pilot script, The Mothers Group Murders, was short-listed for the 2023 Monte Miller Awards.

## Current projects
**The Mothers Group Murders**
After stumbling across a dead body at their first Parents Group meeting, five unlikely friends and their eccentric group nurse band  together to solve a murder. Set in Melbourne's eclectic Inner-North, The Mothers Group Murders is an unexpected comedy, finding laughter in the chaos of five new parents working together to solve a crime.
